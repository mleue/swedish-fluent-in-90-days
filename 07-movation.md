#Motivation Boost

On your way towards fluency in Swedish you will certainly encounter the occasional low and on some days you might think about skipping your daily training (which of course you won't actually do, since you are determined not to break the chain).

This chapter is a compilation of some of the things that helped me to stay motivated throughout my 3 months and is intended to lift your mood and load your motivation. I guess sometimes you just need to spice up your training with some good music or a little movie.

##Music

Music is a big part of my life and on some days it can really make the difference between feeling a little gloomy or to bubble with enthusiasm. So why shouldn't you use this and listen to some Swedish music when you need a little motivation kick?

"Unfortunately" many Swedish artists are very international these days and sing primarily in English (however that's actually not so new considering bands like ABBA). Still I have managed to find a couple of artists whose music I really like, here are my top five and my favourite songs. Usually a lot of their stuff can be found for free on Youtube. A pro tip is to search for the lyrics online and read them while you listen to a song. That way you will get even more out of it.

**Veronica Maggio**. This is happy and very poppy music.

* [Jag kommer (I am coming)][vero1]
* [17 år (17 years)][vero2]

**Håkan Hellström**. Hard to put your finger on what kind of music this is. I like it a lot though. And the first song is like an anthem for Gothenburg, you can hear it playing somewhere in Gothenburg at any given time I'd say.

* [Känn ingen sorg för mig Göteborg (Don't worry about me Gothenburg)][hakan1]
* [Det kommer aldrig va över för mig (It's never gonna be over for me)][hakan2]

**Timbuktu**. This is really nice Swedish rap/reggae. My recommended song will turn any day into a happy one. Watch out for his Skånska accent, as he comes from the southernmost part of Sweden.

* [Alla vill till himlen men ingen vill dö (Everyone wants to go to heaven, but noone wants to die)][timbuktu]

**Laleh**. A very skilled lady that creates a big variety of good music. I would tag many of her songs as pop singer-songwriter.

* [Goliat (Goliath)][laleh1]
* [Vårens första dag (First day of spring)][laleh2]

**Gaby and the Guns**. This is just beautiful, calm Swedish pop music that always gives me a feeling of a little trip through the Swedish landscape on a warm summer day.

* [Börjar från noll (Start at zero)][gaby]

##More Books

If you are really into reading then I can recommend a couple of good books. For some reason Swedish authors (and Scandinavian in general) are really good at crime novels. Maybe the gloomy, dark winter days really do have an effect on your mood. Definitely check out:

* [Millennium-serien (Millennium Trilogy)][millenium]
* [Kurt Wallander (Kurt Wallander novels)][wallander]

 Then quite recently there was a very successful fictional story about the life story of an old Swedish guy who flees from his nursing home in the beginning of the book. In the course of the following adventures he then tells about his life and you start to notice that he was somehow involved in quite a lot of the major political evens that happened over the world in the 20th century. Very funny.

 [Hundraåringen som klev ut genom fönstret och försvann (The 100-year-old-man who climbed out the window and disappeared)][hundra]

##Movies

Sometimes it can be really nice to get some visual input, too. Unfortunately I don't really know or have encountered any good Swedish movies that I would highly recommend to you. Since they never dub English films in Sweden this is not an option either (but to be honest, this is a very good thing). The books I mentioned before have all been made into films, so if you can find them in Swedish (maybe even with Swedish subtitles), then that's totally an option for a nice evening.

Other than that I can recommend the Swedish Televisions [media library][svt]. I especially like their [documentaries][svtdocu], but feel free to check out the other categories and just try some random stuff. Most of the content is not accessible if you don't have a Swedish IP-address but if you scroll down a bit you can check "kan ses utomlands" on the right side to only search among those that you can look at outside of Sweden. If you already live in Sweden, even better, dig in.
