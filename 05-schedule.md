##Daily

Every day for the next 3 months you will do approximately 40 minutes each of the following 3 items.

* flashcards
* listening
* reading

After your main priorities like your job or university, and of course your family, I want you to consider Swedish as the second most important thing in your life for the coming 90 days. Ignore everything that will not have fatal consequences until you are done with your 2 hours of Swedish training for the day. Your day will not be complete until you have crossed off those 3 items from your daily to-do list. Be very strict about this and don't try to fool yourself.

Someday you might find yourself being tired in the evening after some tough hours at the office and all you want to do is go to bed. Well guess what? You're not going to bed yet. You have clearly failed at prioritizing by staying longer at work than usual. Let this be your lesson. Having a continuous streak of days on which you stuck to your plan and executed it against all odds is a powerful tool for keeping you on track. At first just a couple of days, then a week, soon to be a month. You will gain more and more momentum and soon feel that you can easily reach your goals one step at a time. In short: never break the chain.

By saying that you should do „approximately“ 40 minutes of each item every day I do not mean that you should try to be satisfied with e.g. 30 minutes. I rather want you to be flexible about the distribution of your time. On some days you might find that you have many flashcard reviews to do which take you 50 minutes to complete, then of course you can take 10 minutes off one of the other items. That being said, I would actually advise against relying on your inner clock and setting a timer for all your activities to make sure that you really get your 2 hours combined.

Also set up a simple spreadsheet on your computer to track your daily progress in all three categories. It should look like this.

|Day|Pages read|Flashcards|Listening (1-10)|Material|
|---|----------|----------|----------------|--------|
|1|9|200|2|Harry Potter 1, Vet. Värld|
|2|10|287|1|Harry Potter 1, Vet. Värld|
|3|...|...|...|...|

Try to always interpolate/extrapolate when you use more or less than the prescribed 40 minutes for any of the categories. Educated guessing is fine, this is not science. You will benefit from those statistics in various ways:

* every now and then you can use it to plot some progress graphs and be proud of yourself
* learning becomes a bit of a race against yourself, you are less likely to digress when you know that this will result in an ugly little dip in your progress graph
* you will be able to spot when you hit a plateau
    * daily flashcard reviews not increasing anymore? - Perfect!
    * number of pages read still the same as one week ago? - Are you sure you are really focused?
    * listening comprehension somehow stuck on a certain level? - Sounds like someone likes to wander off in their mind!
* by combining performance and material statistics you can easily spot correlations
    * number of pages you read is dropping with a new book? - Maybe you're not really into the topic, try to change the book.
    * listening comprehension is lower for some shows than for others? - Maybe one show uses easier language, listen to more of that.

##Every weekend

Check your progress by going through your daily statistics. Take a moment to check what you think went well this week and what can be improved. Are you still psyched about reading? Are you still looking forward to your podcasts every day? If not, try to make some changes and search for new material.

If you should have finished a book recently then it is time to add your marked sentences and phrases to your phrase deck in Anki. Don't let them pile up.

Weekends are also your opportunity to refill your motivation. Can you still visualize what it will be like to be fluent in Swedish? Can you see how impressed your friends will be when you accomplish this goal in just 3 months? If you have trouble doing this then read the first chapter once more and be sure to dig into the _Motivation Boost_ chapter.

Finally you must skim through the _Cheat Grammar_ chapter. Go a bit deeper into every section that you feel you have noticed coming up in your material. However, don't ever try to memorize any of those rules, just get a feeling for them and know that they exist.
