"Hej", I said, "Jag tar en kopp kaffé och en kanelbulle, tack". This was my first order for a cup of coffee and a cinnamon bun in Swedish, right after landing at Arlanda Airport near Stockholm in the beginning of July 2014, and it couldn't have gone better. I was handing over my credit card to pay and was already imagining me taking a sip of freshly brewed coffee to celebrate this major victory.

Everything seemed to work fine until the cashier looked up from the machine and asked "Kan jag få se ditt leg, tack?". I was a bit stunned and my brain was working hard to put the pieces together, obviously I was required to show some sort of ID when using my German credit card in a foreign country.

Since I was traveling within the EU I actually didn't have my ID or passport on me, but was wondering if my driver's license could do the job. In my mind I was already rushing through the mental drawers, trying to pin down the Swedish word for driver's license. It would have been easy to give up at that moment as it was quite an unexpected situation for me and the temptation to switch to English was big. But I knew I had heard and read the word I was looking for so many times during my studies. I knew I could do it.

And there it was: "körkort", of course. "Jag har bara mitt körkort, går det?" I asked with an apologetic smile and was hoping that there wouldn't be an additional question showing up. "Absolut" she said and quickly glimpsed at my license before I got back my credit card, received my order and ended the conversation with a quick "Tack. Hej då!".

Nice. That was a great feeling. "I did it!" was my first thought. I had promised myself not to use English as soon as I entered Swedish grounds and it felt good not to have broken that promise hastily. I knew that with every sentence my confidence would only grow and I was not planning on breaking that chain. With the coffee in my hand and the bun in my bag I was already on my way to the bus stop to catch a ride into town.

Flash back to March 2014. I had just found out that I got accepted for a Master's degree programme in Gothenburg and would therefore be spending two years in Sweden, starting in September 2014. It was at that moment I somehow realised that I did not speak any Swedish.

I knew some foreign students back at my university in Germany and they could clearly be divided into two groups: those that made an effort and learned some German and those that did not. While the latter group still had a really nice time in Germany, they were certainly mostly socialising in circles of other exchange students. In contrast to that, the ones that learned some German usually had a much easier time actually making German friends outside of the campus.

A perfect example for that was an American guy I got to know as an exchange student in my Bachelor's programme. He had really put some work into learning the language before arriving in Germany and was able to make himself understood from the first day on. He then actively avoided the mostly English-speaking exchange student groups and events and quickly became part of our gang. Through that he created heaps of free language learning opportunities for himself and rocketed his German to a decent level of fluency within a couple of weeks. He always liked to emphasize that he thought that a lot of his best experiences in Germany somehow started out by connecting with the local people, something he thought to be directly related to his fluent German.

I couldn't agree more with this statement. While I have always liked to speak English with the exchange students at the university, I certainly also liked not having to do it at times. When I was for example having a relaxed lunch with my friends or drinking a couple of beers in the evening it just felt more natural to speak German. To me my mothertongue has always been more intuitive and involves less thinking, which I guess is exactly what you want when you are hanging out with your friends.

I believe that nowadays you can get along with English in most parts of the world quite nicely, but if you want to stay somewhere for an extended period of time and really get to know the culture and people and create some long-lasting friendships it is still very vital to learn the local language.

So for me it was an easy decision. If I wanted to be in Sweden for a couple of years I had to learn the language. And with a whole summer and very few plans ahead of me I thought I might as well just begin right away and get a headstart.

##The language gene

You probably found this guide because you are highly unsatisfied with your current experiences of how languages are being taught and the snail pace at which you are supposed to learn them.

How can it take several years to get to a decent level of language proficiency? Why is it so incredibly expensive to take language courses? Why is it that many say the only language learning shortcut is to move to that country and fully immerse yourself 24/7? Is there some language gene you should possess or is it just that the current teaching methods suck?

That's the questions I had before I started digging a bit deeper and found resources and people that raised similar reservations and tried to propose solutions.

My own horizon was probably very limited by the experiences of my language learning attempts in school and university.

I’ve had 4 years of French back in high school and honestly did not learn anything at all and could not have the most basic conversation today. All that those 4 years taught me were many bad ways to approach language learning. It was a very frustrating experience and despite considering myself to be quite a smart student overall, French remained entirely impenetrable and I attended every lesson with a feeling of fear and defeat.

In university I then tried to pick up languages again, somehow thinking that French must have been a big misunderstanding. I enrolled in a Spanish course, paying 120€ for 3 months. Unfortunately it was French lessons all over again, focusing on how to conjugate verbs or learning lists of vocabulary that you could not connect to anything even mildly interesting. It just didn’t cut it for me. The course felt like a major pain and I quitted early.

The funniest thing was probably that this was the first of 8 courses that would step-by-step bring you to some kind of fluency level. The whole package would therefore have taken 2 years and have costed several hundreds of euros.

All those experiences were really imprinted in my mind, making language learning seem very hard and highly dependent on talent and the money you were willing to put in.

But over the following three months I learned that I had to rewrite a lot of what I had been thinking.

I now know that ...

* ... fluency in a language can be reached within only a couple of months.
* ... it does not necessarily have to be very expensive to learn a language, in fact it can come at the price of what the usual courses will charge you for only a few hours.
* ... you can reach fluency without ever visiting a country where the language is spoken.
* ... it is indeed the old teaching methods that are ineffective and that there is certainly no such thing as a language gene.

##Where you are headed

In the making of this guide I have received many requests asking me about what I actually mean by _fluency_ and what level of language proficiency one can expect after 3 months of following this guide.

Unfortunately I have never actually taken a Swedish language test to determine my level of proficiency after 3 months of learning. Now, after more than a year of actually living in Sweden, it is too late to do it and I have advanced far beyond the level that I had when I first arrived here.

In Europe, language proficiency is usually described in terms of CEFR levels. This is the _Common European Framework of Reference for Languages_, a system of 6 levels (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2) from complete beginner to master in a language. The three highest levels (B2, C1, C2) are increasingly advanced levels of fluency.

According to this system, and the concise explanations that can be found on [Wikipedia][cefr], I had just reached the fifth level (C1):

* Can understand a wide range of demanding, longer texts, and recognize implicit meaning
* Can express ideas fluently and spontaneously without much obvious searching for expressions
* Can produce clear, well-structured, detailed text on complex subjects, showing controlled use of organizational patterns, connectors and cohesive devices
* Can use language flexibly and effectively for social, academic and professional purposes

While I totally agree with the first three statements I have to remark that I do not think that I would have been able to use Swedish for any academic purpose or any complex subject. Even now, more than a year later, I would not say that I could. It is clearly a question of special vocabulary that I simply don't know.

However, I think that this is not relevant at all. I don't want to be an expert on all possible topics, because I will never encounter 90% of them. Instead, especially when time is short and valuable, I will always choose to spend my time on things that I really enjoy/am interested in/need for a professional purpose.

Adding the required vocabulary to your active language set can then easily be done when it is actually required. With my method this will be a matter of a week.

Bottomline: Late B2 or early C1 is where we are headed. And in my eyes that is a perfect level to be able to move to that country, enjoy living there and make any further language progress a matter of basically living your life with open eyes and ears.[^21]

##What is your motivation?

For me, there was a clear relation between moving to another country and learning the language. The quality of my life and the ability to make new friends or experience awesome things during that period of time would depend heavily on my knowledge of the language.

All those are strong intrinsic (coming from inside yourself) reasons to follow your dream and gain motivation every day even in extended time spans like 3 months. They are crucial to keep you going in the long run and not loose your focus if things should start to become a bit stressful.

To shape this mindset I want you to write down at least 3 intrinsic incentives as to why it is important for you to learn Swedish. These have to come from deep inside yourself, as opposed to extrinsic reasons that are imposed on you from the outside. Examples for extrinsic motivation could be:

* because my employer wants me to
* because a friend advised me to

However, notice that these examples can be converted into intrinsic ones. The first example might just as well be:

* because I will benefit from it heavily at my job and it will enable me to advance to the position in the company that I always wanted to have

Here are some examples for deep intrinsic motivations:

* because this will enable me to become a Swedish citizen
* because that way I can help my daughter with her homework
* because I want to feel more at home here
* because I want to be able to invite my neighbours over for tea
* because I do not want to be the outsider
* because I will feel more comfortable in every-day situations

There are thousands of possibilities, try to pick those that seem strongest to you and appeal to you deeply.

##Take action

1. Grab some paper and a pen and get comfortable. Write down the three most compelling intrinsic motivations you have for becoming fluent in Swedish. Tape this as a note on your bathroom mirror so that you are reminded every morning and evening.

2. Now close your eyes and try to imagine one of your motivations becoming true once you reach your goal. Try to visualize it as vivid and colourful as possible and focus especially on how happy you would feel.
