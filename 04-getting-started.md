#Getting Started

> The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
>
> -- <cite>Lao Tzu</cite>

I hope you are eager to get started right away, so let's begin with the first step and set everything up so you can jump head first into your training every day without having to waste energy on the organization of things. You only have a limited amount of willpower each day to convince yourself to stay on top of your goals. That's why it is vital to cut down on the overhead of your tasks and reduce the friction so you can get started smoothly and without worrying every day.

##Listening

The Swedish radio app can be downloaded from your respective appstore by searching for „Sveriges Radio Play“. It is currently available for Android and Iphone.

If you don't own a smartphone you can just go to their [site][sverigesradio] and access all the content via your browser on your computer.

###Workflow for finding good content on the app

The following 4 images show you the basic workflow for finding content on the Android app. The basic steps will be pretty much the same for the Iphone app.

###Workflow on the website

The same functionality can be accessed on the website.

![Accessing the list of all available shows][sv_site_1]

For all shows that you find interesting just click on them and create a bookmark for them in your browser so that you can easily find them in the coming days.

###How to choose a show

Apart from the three shows that I already mentioned (_Vetandets Värld_, _P3 Dokumentär_ and _P1 Dokumentär_) I would strongly advise you to just skim through the available shows and translate whatever catches your attention with the [Google translator][translate].

##Flashcards

Luckily there is not much thinking involved on your side here. I have already prepared an Anki deck with 10,000 awesome Swedish-English flashcards for you. All of them I have checked to be:

* correct in both languages
* diverse
* ordered in increasing difficulty

So you can just lean back and feed them to your brain.

###Import into Anki

Anki can be downloaded at [http://ankisrs.net/][anki]. If you want to also use it on your smartphone, there are apps for Android (free) and Iphone (not free) that I would highly recommend you to use for convenience and mobility reasons. If you aim to do so you must also create an account at [https://ankiweb.net/][ankiweb] in order to synchronize your deck over several devices. However, it is perfectly fine to use the desktop software on your computer to do your reviews.

Once installed you can just import the deck I prepared for you, an .apkg file, by selecting it from the import dialogue.

You should now see your deck in Anki.

###Anki best practises

The following are a couple of methods that I incorporate when I learn languages with flashcards on Anki. You can regard them as the 20% of stuff to keep in mind for boosting your Anki effectivity to at least 80%.[^41]

####How to add 100 cards each day

As said before you must add 100 new cards to your active set every day. The common way of doing this in Anki would be to go into the settings of the deck and schedule a daily addition of 100 cards. However, I strongly advise you to instead always go through your revisions first and then once you are done with those, click on "Custom Study" and "Increase today's new card limit" and add 100 cards that way.

![Adding new cards via custom study in Anki][sv_anki_add100]

The reason for this is that if you schedule 100 new cards automatically every day, Anki will mix them with your reviews when you process your deck. I find it much easier and straightforward to first go through my reviews thinking "I should know those" and then through the new cards thinking "those are new, watch out". This little trick helped me to cut down on my time spent on Anki every day quite significantly.

####Be quick to delete

Don't hesitate to erase whatever cards you find uninspiring, boring or fail to remember several times in a row. The 10,000 phrases in your deck are many more than you will need (100 cards * 90 days = 9,000) and this is for a reason. How fast you learn with Anki depends a lot on how much you like your cards. So just drop all cards that you find uninspiring or boring. Also if you can't remember certain cards several times in a row, then that's most likely due to the fact that the context of the phrase doesn't create the necessary picture in your head. Delete without thinking twice.

####Use Mnemonics for tough nuts

Sometimes you might feel that a certain word just won't get a hold in your memory however often you see it, but you also think that it is an important vocabulary that you don't want to delete. In those cases try to incorporate the mnemonics technique of creating a vivid picture for that word in your head.

You basically take the tough word and relate it to something you know which sounds at least vaguely like the one you are trying to remember. Now imagine a picture or scene with as many odd details as possible in your head, based on the familiar word. This picture must describe the meaning of the tough word you are trying to remember. This is probably explained best with a couple of examples of how I remembered some hard Swedish words.

Swedish|English|How I remembered it
-----------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------
snål | to be close-fisted | The word "snål" reminded me of the English "snail". So I thought of a giant, slimy snail wearing a top hat, a monocle and a fancy moustache just like a capitalist from the early industrialization. I saw a scene where his workers begged him for a higher wage but he refused to do so because he was too close-fisted.
städa | to clean | The word "städa" reminded me of the German word "Stadt" (which means "town"/"city" in English). I then thought of taking a walk in my hometown and all the neighbors were out on the streets cleaning the whole town with giant brooms.
låsa | to lock | The word "låsa" reminded me of the word "laser". I imagined a door to some super secret room that was locked with all kinds of different heavy locks but I would just use a laser to cut a man-sized hole into the door and enter the locked room anyway.

Now you might think it is a little overkill to come up with a little story everytime you can't remember a word. But then again you should really only use this technique for the tough nuts that won't stay in your brain even after several repetitions. Also you will become better and better at creating those funny little pictures in an instant.

####Use the timer in Anki

One important thing to keep in mind when going through your flashcards in Anki is to always be _quick_. If you have an average of around 400 (300 reviews, 100 new ones) cards to look at each day then the average time you can spend on each of them is 6sec. This might sound very fast, but in fact it isn't really. I have made the experience that you either know the phrase right from the start or you are not going to remember it anyway. So usually you can even be much faster than 6sec and therefore have some time to think about the occasional tough card.

In order not to linger on a single card for a long time I strongly advise you to make use of the "answer timer" function in Anki. I have already set it up for you in the provided deck so you don't have to go into the settings yourself.

##Reading

I hope you have already thought about some books that you would like to read in Swedish. As mentioned before, if you like the Harry Potter books and have read them before I can highly recommend them to start out with. Otherwise regard the following tips.

###How to choose a good book

I think the best books to read when learning a foreign language should have the following characteristics.

* easy language
    * this doesn’t mean it has to be a children’s book, just something that is not too fancy, like e.g. most crime novels and certainly unlike e.g. most of the stuff that wins Nobel Prizes
* relevant language
    * most of us are probably aiming to use our newly acquired language in everyday situations, so don’t read a book on physics, even if that might be interesting to you
* modern language
* you have read the book before or know the story well
* you would like to read it even if it wasn’t for the language learning

Look out for those 5 points and you will be sucked right into your book and have a blast, and that's what it should be all about.

###How to actually find your favourite book in Swedish

If there is a translation to Swedish for your book then it is probably a rather well-known publication and the easiest way is therefore to search for it on Wikipedia and then change the language to "Svenska" which will show you the same article but in the Swedish Wikipedia and therefore also the Swedish title. Another way would be to just search for it online using the English title like e.g. "50 shades of grey svenska".

If you can't find a store in your country that sells the books you want in Swedish then you can try the biggest Swedish online bookstore [bokus][bokus].[^42] To find ebooks on bokus just search for "bookname ebok" or go directly to their [ebook subcategory][bokusebok]. Whenever you run into something in Swedish you don't understand, just use Google translate and get the overall idea.

###Using ebooks

I like to use ebooks whenever possible, because on my reader I can easily mark phrases and sentences. You can also read and mark on your computer or phone. The marked sentences can then be pulled over to my computer and added to my flashcards very quickly, which can be a huge time and frustration saver (think about how much fun it is to type hundreds of phrases into your computer). Being able to complement your card deck with phrases that you have chosen yourself (as opposed to the ones you just download) is a vital step towards fluency because you can really target all the stuff that you don't understand yet.

Also in many cases if you don't live in Sweden, ebooks will be the only reasonable way to actually get your hands on the particular book you want. Usually bookstores have a small foreign language section, but the choice there is rather limited.

##Additional

As I mentioned before I advise you to always use Google translate whenever you encounter some resource in Swedish that you do not understand yet and quickly want to get the gist of the content. Google translate is far from perfect and spits out some pretty funny mistakes sometimes but it is a great tool for getting the overall idea of a text in a foreign language very quickly.

Apart from that I can really recommend the English-Swedish dictionary at [http://ensv.dict.cc/][ensvdict] that not only gives you translations but a lot of additional information about verbs, adjectives and nouns when you click on them.

##Take Action

1. Install the "Sveriges Radio Play" app on your phone or visit [Sveriges Radio's website][sverigesradio]. Search for at least three shows that sound interesting and add them to your favourites or save them as a bookmark.

2. Install the Anki software on your computer and import the provided deck. Take 5 minutes to familiarize yourself with the graphical interface of the software. (Optional: If you want to use Anki on your phone, too, then download the app from your respective Appstore and create an account at [ankiweb][ankiweb] to be able to synchronize over several devices.)

3. Take 10 minutes to sit down and think of 3 books that you would like to read in Swedish. Find out what their title is in Swedish and order them or download as ebooks. If you have an ebook-reader, put them on there. If not, install a software for reading ebooks on your computer, phone or tablet.

[^41]: If you want to learn more about Anki and how to use it for maximum effect check out Alex Vermeer's guide [Anki essentials][ankiessentials], which is a great resource for all tips and tricks.
[^42]: When creating an account at [bokus][bokus] you will be asked to enter your "Personnummer" which is a unique number for every Swedish citizen. You can just skip that field and not worry about it if you don't have one.
