Congratulations, you've already reached the end of this guide. Hopefully you have learned a lot and are enthusiastic and highly motivated to get started right away. If you did everything I told you to do in the _Take Action_ blocks, then you are mentally and physically prepared to shoot for the stars.

Just remember that this guide is no book to read once and then put it somewhere and forget about it. Look at it rather as your cookbook with a lot of interesting recipes to learn Swedish fast. I highly recommend to skim through the first chapters every couple of weeks to make sure that you are getting the best out of your daily training. Also you really have to take a quick look at the _Cheating Grammar_ chapter every weekend and check the _Motivation Boost_ whenever you feel that your motivation is not at its best.

One last thing I want you to take away from this guide is to realize that you are aiming very high with this goal. This is a deliberate part of the plan and will play a huge role for your success. The point is that even if you don't feel as fluent as you wanted or thought you would be after 3 months, it will, in any case, be a major success compared to whatever you would have achieved in that timeframe if you had not tried.

As long as you stick to your training and practice deliberately, and without fooling yourself, day by day, then there is no way that you can fail.

I have done it and you can do it, too.

Thank you for reading.
