#Cheating Grammar

> Grammar is a piano I play by ear.
>
> -- <cite>Joan Didion</cite>

The following 15 grammatical constructs cover pretty much everything you need to know about Swedish grammar. I don't want you to memorize any of this but rather to understand why and how it is used. You will encounter many of these concepts as time goes by, so there is no use in trying to take all of them in right from the beginning.

Here is when to actually use this chapter:

* Every weekend, skim the chapter and try to spot patterns that you have encountered in your input and make sure you understand what is going on
* Every time you see some weird grammar that you do not understand, look it up here

Please also note that the following compilation does not cover everything there is to know about Swedish grammar. But it sure covers the 80% of important stuff that you need to know. There is nothing more that you should worry about. Once you understand all those concepts you are most certainly a lot better at Swedish grammar than the average Swede. Also note that I usually only explain every item by giving you a couple of examples. If you understand the example sentences, you are pretty much good to go.

The feeling for those concepts will come with input and time, just try to understand the examples and be aware of the existence of certain grammatical rules.

##Basics

Just so we are on the same page, here are some basics that you should definitely know when talking about grammar and that you will need to know in order to understand the following explanations.

Name|Description|Examples
------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------
Verbs|Words describing what you do|make, do, build, paint, think
Nouns|Words describing things or beings and that in English you can put a "the" in front of|person, table, laptop, animal, water, car
Adjectives|Words describing what a noun is like|blue, shiny, quick, stable, dangerous
Adverbs|Words describing what a verb is like|quickly, thoroughly, gently, fiercely, softly
Prepositions|Small words describing the relations between the objects in a sentence|in, under, before, for, until
Pronouns|Words that substitute persons or nouns|I, you, me, he, she, it, that, them
Conjugate|To alter a verb according to who is doing it (I, you, he/she/it, we, you, they) or a certain tense (past, future, etc.)|I do it, you do it, he does it, we do it, you do it, they do it, he did it, he has done it

##Additional letters

In Swedish in addition to a standard 26 character Latin alphabet there are 3 more characters.

###Ä/ä

For the sound of "ä" you can think of how you pronounce "any" in English and try to only vocalize the "a" in the beginning or how you pronounce "egg" and only vocalize the "e" in the beginning. That is pretty much what it sounds like.

###Ö/ö

The sound of "ö" is a bit harder to find a good example for. Think of the "o" in the English word "work" and try to pronounce only that one character. That's not 100% but it gives you a good idea.

###Å/å

Try to pronounce it like the "o" in the English word "for".

##Numbers

Number|Svenska
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
0, 1, 2, 3, 4|noll, ett, två, tre, fyra
5, 6, 7, 8, 9|fem, sex, sju, åtta, nio
10, 11, 12, 13, 14|tio, elva, tolv, tretton, fjorton

6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th|sjette, sjunde, åttonde, nionde, tionde

##Personal pronouns

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
jag|I
du|you
han/hon|he/she
vi|we
ni|you
de (pronounced like "domm")|they

##En or Ett

Nouns can either be described in an indefinite ("a house" or "an apple") or a definite way ("the house"). In Swedish, nouns can either be entitled as "en" or "ett" in the indefinite form (which basically means that there are two different categories of nouns) and when you want to point out a noun in particular and use the definite form you have to add that identifier to the end of the word.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Jag vill ha _en boll_.|I want to have _a ball_.
Kan du ge mig _bollen_?|Can you give me _the ball_?
Jag står på _ett bord_.|I am standing on _a table_.
Kan du hjälpa mig bära _bordet_?|Can you help me carry _the table_?

So this is pretty straightforward. Whenever you would say "a" or "an" in English you have the identifier in front of the noun and when you would say "the" you add the identifier to the end of the noun.

Whether a noun is "en" or "ett" is entirely random (the only rule of thumb that I know is: all living beings are "en") and just has to be learned. This will come with input.

##Plural

Depending on whether a noun is "ett" or "en", there are different rules to build the plural. Observe that even for the plural there is an indefinite or a definite form, just like in English you could talk about "some houses" without meaning any in particular or "the houses" when you want to point out some specific houses.

###ett case

This is pretty simple. In general the noun stays unchanged for the indefinite case, and in the definite case you add "-en" to the end of the word (yes, "-en", just like to an "en" word in the singular case, this can be a bit confusing in the beginning).

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Jag äger _flera hus_.|I own _several houses_.
Det finns inga lediga _bord_ här.|There are no empty _tables_ here.

: Indefinite case

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
_Husen_ jag äger är fina.|The _houses_ I own are very nice.
_Borden_ är för små|_The tables_ are too small.

: Definite case

###en case

Here it starts to be a bit tricky. Now you basically have to add either "-ar", "-er" or "-or" to the noun in the indefinite form and then in addition to that you have to add "-an" in the definite form.

####-or

This one is the only straightforward case of the three. It holds true for every noun that ends on "a" in the singular, which are quite many, luckily.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
en blomm<u>a</u>, flera blomm<u>or</u>|one flower, several flowers
en flask<u>a</u>, flera flask<u>or</u>|one bottle, several bottles

: Indefinite case

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
blomm<u>an</u>, blomm<u>orna</u>|the flower, the flowers
flask<u>an</u>, flask<u>orna</u>|the bottle, the bottles

: Definite case

####-ar, -er

There are some tricky rules that can help you decide when to use what. I have honestly never learned them and just waited to get a natural feeling for these cases with time. Here are some examples of what it would look like:

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
en bil, flera bil<u>ar</u>|one car, several cars
en dator, flera dator<u>er</u>|one computer, several computers
en stol, flera stol<u>ar</u>|one chair, several chairs
en telefon, flera telefon<u>er</u>|one telephone, several telephones

: Indefinite case

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
bilen, bil<u>arna</u>|the car, the cars
datorn, dator<u>erna</u>|the computer, the computers
stolen, stol<u>arna</u>|the chair, the chairs
telefonen, telefon_erna_|the telephone, the telephones

: Definite case

I hope this makes things a bit clearer. If you feel a bit lost right now, let me tell you: Swedish plural is one of the trickiest parts of Swedish grammar. Try to be happy about the two cases that are easy to distinguish and don't worry so much about anything. It will all come with time and input.

##General verb conjugation

In general all verbs end on "-a" in base form.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
att hoppa|to jump
att sitta|to sit

When you conjugate them it is the same conjugation for every person, which is a very nice feature of the Swedish language. However, the conjugation for the present tense can either end on "-ar" or "-er".

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
jag hopp<u>ar</u>|I jump
jag sitt<u>er</u>|I sit

A few verbs are irregular and don't really fit into this scheme. Most of them end on -s and you can find a description of them in the following section. Two other irregulars verb to be aware of are the super important auxiliary verbs (helping verbs) "att kunna" and "att vilja", which is "to be able to" and "to want" in English.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
att kunna, jag kan|to be able to, I can
att vilja, jag vill|to want, I want to

Luckily most verbs are regular in the present tense and whether a verb ends on -ar or -er will just come naturally to you with time.

##Added -s

Usually verbs in Swedish end on an -a in the base form or -ar or -er when you conjugate the verb in present tense. However, in some cases it can happen that a verb ends on -s. When does that happen?

###To express "each other"

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Vi _hörs_ imorgon.|See you tomorrow. (Literally: We will _hear each other_ tomorrow.)
Vi _ses_ snart.|See you soon. (Literally: We will _see each other_ soon.)
Ska vi _träffas_ på eftermiddag?|How about we _meet each other_ in the afternoon?

###To express a passive voice

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Det _görs_ så här.|You do it like this. (Literally: This _is done_ like this.)
Det _stavas_ så här.|You spell it like this. (Literally: This _is spelled_ like this.)
_Öppnas_ här.|_To be opened_ here.

###For no obvious reason

Sometimes a verb is just conjugated that way. Note that the -s will come along for all tenses. The most important verbs are:

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
att hoppa<u>s</u>|to hope
att låtsa<u>s</u>|to pretend
att anda<u>s</u>|to breathe
att lycka<u>s</u>|to succeed
att minna<u>s</u>|to remember
att finna<u>s</u>|to exist

##Present tense

The above described conjugations are for the present tense. One important remark here is that there is no such thing as the present participle form as in English, the one that is built with "verb + ing". In English this is usually used to describe ongoing actions like. There is no such form in Swedish and you would just translate it with the normal present tense.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
jag springer|I run / I am running
han frågar|he asks / he is asking
vi bakar|we bake / we are baking

##To be somewhere or to go somewhere

In Swedish there is a difference between saying that you are/will be at some place or that you are going/intending to go to some place.

###Being there/planning to be there (här, där, hemma)

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Jag är redan _här_.|I am already _here_
Jag kommer att vara _där_ ikväll.|I will be _there_ tonight.
Jag är _hemma_ just nu.|I am _at home_ right now.

###Going there/planning to go there (hit, dit, hem)

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Han kommer _hit_ efter frukost.|He will come _here_ after breakfast.
Jag tror jag går _dit_ om en timme.|I think I will go _there_ in an hour.
Jag vill gå _hem_ nu.|I want to go _home_ now.

##mer/fler mycket/många mesta/flesta

If you want more of something, you have to be aware of whether you can count that particular thing or not (just like the distinction between "many" and "much" in English). This can be obvious stuff like fluids (e.g. water) but also more abstract words like food.

###mer/fler

For things you can count, use "fler" and for things you can't count use "mer".

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Kan jag få lite _mer_ vatten, tack?|Can I have some _more_ water, please?
Finns det _mer_ mat?|Is there _more_ food?
Jag vill äta _fler_ bullar.|I want to eat _more_ buns.

####You also use mer/fler to compare things

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Jag drack _mer_ vatten än du.|I drank _more_ water than you.
Jag har ätit _fler_ bullar än du.|I have eaten _more_ buns than you.

###mycket/många

For things you can count use "många", for things you can't count use "mycket".

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Det finns _mycket_ vatten på jorden.|There is _much (a lot of)_ water on earth.
Du dricker _för mycket_ kaffé.|You drink _too much_ coffee.
Jag äger _många_ klänningar.|I own _many_ dresses.
Jag har ätit _för många_ bullar.|I have eaten _too many_ buns.

###mest/flest

For things you can count use "flest", for things you can't count use "mest".

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Jag drack _mest_ vatten igår.|I drank the _most_ water yesterday.
Jag har ätit _flest_ bullar.|I have eaten the _most_ buns.

##Det finns

That one is easy, but I have seen it spread a bit of confusion and it is a construction that you will use many times.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
_Det finns_ inte så mycket kvar att säga.|_There is_ not much left to say.
_Det finns_ olika anledningar till det.|_There are_ various reasons for this.

And here is a neat expression I like a lot.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
_Det finns_ lite lunch nu.|Lunch is ready. (Literally: _There is_ some lunch now.)

Note that it can express both "there is" and "there are". Why is that so? Because as mentioned before, in Swedish the conjugation of a verb is the same for every person.

##gång/gånger, tid, dags

Describing time in Swedish can be unexpectedly tricky. Whenever you could safely use the word "time" in English you have to be aware of different cases in the Swedish language.

###gång/gånger

Use those to describe "how many times" something happens. "gång" is the singular, "gånger" the plural form.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Jag har sagt det här så många _gånger_ nu.|I have said that so many _times_ now.
Jag ringde dig bara en _gång_.|I only rang you _once (one time)_.
Jag vet inte hur många _gånger_ jag har varit på semester där.|I don't know how many _times_ I have been on holidays there.

###tid

Use "tid" to describe "time" as in "being on time" or "having time".

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Jag kommer aldrig i _tid_.|I am never on _time_.
Jag har inte så mycket _tid_ just nu.|I don't have a lot of _time_ right now.
Hur mycket _tid_ finns kvar?|How much _time_ is left?

###dags

Use "dags" to express when it is "time" for something, or something is "about time".

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Det var _verkligen dags_!|It was _about time_!
Nu är det _dags_ att lägga sig.|It is _time_ to sleep now.
Det är _dags_ att gå till jobbet.|It is _time_ to go to work.

##i/på/om en timme

When you want to talk about a certain time interval (e.g. "en timme", "one hour"), there are certain prepositions to use for certain cases.

###i en timme

Use this to express that something has taken you "one hour", this can best be translated with "for one hour".

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Jag väntade _i en timme_ imorse.|I waited _for one hour_ this morning.
Jag har pluggat Svenska _i två månader_.|I have studied Swedish _for two months_.

###på en timme

Use this to describe how long a certain activity will take.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Det här kan man göra _på tre timmar_.|You can do this _in (within) three hours_.
Man kan flyga till Island _på tre timmar_.|You can fly to Iceland _in (within) three hours_.

Sometimes it can be a bit hard to distinguish between the "på" and the "in" case and I have the feeling that the Swedes are not very consistent with it either. That is why I usually try to rephrase the "på" case in the following way.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Att göra det här _tar tre timmar_.|It _takes three hours_ to do this.
Att flyga till Island _tar tre timmar_.|It _takes three hours_ to fly to Iceland.

###om en timme

Use this when you want to say that something will happen in a certain time-span from now.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Jag kommer att lämna _om en timme_.|I am going to leave _in an hour_.
Vi ses _om en vecka_.|We'll see each _other in a week_.

Of course all these cases can be used with whatever time-interval.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
en sekund, tre sekunder|one second, three seconds
en minut, tre minuter|one minute, three minutes
en timme, tre timmar|one hour, three hours
en dag, tre dagar|one day, three days
en vecka, tre veckor|one week, three weeks
ett år, tre år|one year, three years

##i helgen/på helgen/i måndags

If you want to talk about specific weekdays or time-periods like seasons or christmas in the past, present or the future there are also some things to look out for in Swedish.

###past events

This can be pretty confusing. There are a lot of different cases. Also for events like seasons or christmas or easter you have to say "i" and then add "-as" to the end of the word (and possibly even change the spelling of the word in order to make it less hard to pronounce). Please don't try to learn this, it will come with time and is more like a compilation of common phrases.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Jag började lära mig Svenska _för ett år sen_.|I started learning Swedish _one year ago_.
Hela mitt liv förandrades _för en månad sen_.|My whole life changed _one month ago_.
_I somras_ reste jag till Spanien.|_This summer_ I made a trip to Spain.
_I höstas_ såg träden fina ut.|_This autumn_ the trees looked beautiful.
_I julas_ fick jag många presenter.|_This christmas_ I received many presents.
_I mars_ blev det äntligen vår. (this can also mean the coming March and you can only tell by the tense that is being used)|_In march_ spring finally arrived.
_Förra veckan_ mådde jag inte så bra.|_Last week_ I didn't feel so well.
Vad har du gjort _i helgen_? (this could also mean the upcoming weekend and you can only tell by the tense that is being used)|What did you do _this weekend_?
_I tisdags_ skrev jag en viktig tenta.|_On Tuesday_ I wrote an important exam.
Jag kom hit _igår_.|I came here _yesterday_.
_I natt_ hade jag svårt att somna.|_Last night_ I had a heard time falling asleep.
_I morse_ hade jag ägg till frukost.|_This morning_ I had eggs for breakfast.

##present day events

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
_I dag_ tränar jag lite.|_Today_ I'm exercising a little.
_I kväll_ ska jag gå ut och dricka öl.|_Tonight_ I am going to go out and have a beer.

###future events

Be aware that sometimes you can only tell if past or future is meant (e.g. "i helgen" or "i mars") by the tense that is being used.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
_I morgon_ måste jag gå och handla.|_Tomorrow_ I'll have to go shopping.
_I helgen_ ska jag festa.|I will party _this weekend_.
_På lördag_ kommer jag inte gå upp tidigt.|_On saturday_ I am not going to go upp early.
_Nästa vecka_ har jag mycket att göra.|_Next week_ there will be a lot to do.
_Om ett år_ kommer jag börja jobba.|_In one year_ I will start working.

##ju, nog

Those two tiny words are often found in Swedish sentences when you want to emphasize or underline a certain statement. Just know that it exists and get a feeling for it through input. It is nothing you really need to incorporate but I have actually grown quite fond of the concept. It is hard to translate them directly, so the examples are really only examples. I will demonstrate the nuances with some comparisons.

###ju

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Det var det ja sa. / Det var _ju_ det ja sa.|That was what I said. / That was _just_ what I said.
"Men det sa du inte!" - "_Ju_, det var det ja sa."|"But you didn't say that." - "_Yes_, that was what I said."

###nog

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Det här kommer inte gå. / Det här kommer _nog_ inte gå.|This is not going to work. / This is _just_ not going to work.
Konserten var _nog_ inte så bra.|The concert was _somehow_ not so good.

##The different flavours of adjectives (-t, -a)

In Swedish an adjective can have three different endings, it's standard ending, a "-t" ending or an "-a" ending. I will explain the differences and when to use them with the examples of "pretty" or "nice", the Swedish adjective "fin", and "fast", the Swedish adjective "snabb".

###fin, snabb

Use this standard ending when you use the adjective to describe an "en" noun.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Den där bilen är _snabb_.|That car is _fast_.
Jag letar efter en _fin_ klänning.|I am looking for a _pretty_ dress.

###fint, snabbt

Use the "-t" ending either when you describe an "ett" noun or when you actually use the adjective as an adverb and thus describe a verb. Please also observe that in addition with the super common phrase "Det ..." ("That ...") you also always use "-t" form (see the last example in this section).

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Ni har verkligen ett fin<u>t</u> hus.|You really have a nice house.
Bordet är väldigt lite<u>t</u>, men fin<u>t</u>.|The table is really small, but nice.
Jag vet att du kan göra det. Men kan du göra det snabb<u>t</u>?|I know that you can do it. But can you do it fast?
Jag kan springa snabb<u>t</u>.|I can run fast.
Det gick snabb<u>t</u>.|That went fast.

###fina, snabba

There are three cases when you use the "-a" ending. Firstly when you describe the plural form of either an "en" or "ett" noun. Secondly when you want to directly (meaning that the adjective is directly before the noun in definite form in the word order of the phrase) describe an "en" or "ett" word in the definite form. And thirdly when you describe possession. A

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Den här fin<u>a</u> bilen tar jag.|I'll take this nice car.
Den snabb<u>a</u> hästen vann.|The fast horse won.
Hon har så många fin<u>a</u> skor.|She has so many pretty shoes.
Snabb<u>a</u> förändringar sker inte så ofta.|Fast changes don't happen so often.
Det här är min fin<u>a</u> bil.|That is my beautiful car.
Kan du visa mig hennes fin<u>a</u> ritning?|Can you show me her nice drawing?

With time all this will come quite naturally to you. Just two remarks here. The omnipotent "bra" is never being changed, so that makes life a bit easier for you. Also note that in some few cases instead of the "-a" ending adjectives can have a "-e" ending. Just be aware of that, it is still only three cases you have to consider, just that some adjectives like to make it a bit harder for you.

##lite/liten/litet/lilla/små

When you want to describe that some thing is "little" or "small" there are obviously several ways of doing it in Swedish and some even pretend to be a solution when really they are not. Seemingly one "little" word can lead to a bit of confusion, so let's clarify this.

###lite

This has actually nothing to do with something being "little" or "small" and could rather be translated as "a little", "a bit" or "some".

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Kan jag få _lite_ vatten?|May I have _a little_ water?
Det tar _lite_ tid.|It takes _a bit_ of time. / It takes _a little_ while.
Jag känner mig _lite_ bättre idag.|I am feeling _a little_ better today.
Vi har just ätit _lite_ snacks.|We have just eaten _some_ snacks.

###liten

Use this one to describe "en" words.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Jag har bara en _liten_ lägenhet.|I only have a _small_ apartment.
Titta! Vilken _liten_ cykel det är.|Look! What a _tiny_ bike that is.

###litet

Use this one to describe "ett" words.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Mitt kök är ganska _litet_.|My kitchen is quite _small_.
Bordet är verkligen för _litet_.|The table is really too _small_.

###lilla

Use this one for the definite case of either "en" or "ett".

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Den här _lilla_ bilen är min.|This _tiny_ car is mine.
Det där _lilla_ skåpet kommer inte räcka till alla mina kläder.|That _little_ wardrobe is not going to be enough för all my clothes.

###små

Use this one for the plural case of either "en" or "ett".

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Du ser bara många _små_ bitar, men inte hela bilden.|You only see a lot of _small_ pieces, but not the whole picture.
Jag tycker bäst om _små_ hus.|I like _little_ houses best.

Observe that, as described in the _flavours of adjectives_, for virtually any other adjective you will come across the last two cases ("lilla" and "små") will be the same word.

##det här/där, den här/där, de här/där / denna, detta, dessa

When you want to point out some noun even more than with just the definite form, you use "den här" "den där" in Swedish. In English this would translate to "this", "that" or "these", "those" in plural.

###First the difference between "den här" and "den där".

Use "den här" when something is close to you, both in space or time.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
_Den här_ cykeln är fin.|_This_ bike is nice. (as for e.g. the bike you stand right next to)
_Den här_ dagen blir bara bättre och bättre.|_This_ day is just getting better. (as for e.g. the present day)

Use "den där" when something is further away from you, both in space or time.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
_Den där_ cykeln är fin.|_That_ bike is nice. (as for e.g. that bike on the other side of the street)
_Den där_ dagen blev bara bättre och bättre.|_That_ day just got better and better. (as for e.g. some day in the past)

###den här/där or denna

Both these are used for "en" nouns and can be used interchangeably. Just note that after "den här/den där" you use the definite form of the noun and after "denna" you use the indefinite form. Both sentences would translate to exactly the same in English.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
_Den här_ bilen är rod. / _Denna_ bil är röd.|_This_ car is red.
_Den där_ maten var så god. / _Denna_ mat var så god.|_That_ food was so delicious.

###det här/där or detta

Exactly the same, just for "ett" nouns.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
_Det här_ huset tycker jag mycket om. / _Detta_ hus tycker jag mycket om.|I like _this_ house a lot.
_Det där_ var inte så smart. / _Detta_ var inte så smart.|_That_ was not so smart.

###de här/där or dessa

Exactly the same, just for plural of either "en" or "ett" nouns.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
_De här_ fåglarna är så fina. / _Dessa_ fåglar är så fina.|_These_ birds are so pretty.
Jag gillar inte _de där_ personerna. / Jag gillar inte _dessa_ personer.|I don't like _those_ people.

So in summary: it is up to you which form you want to use (or just mix them both). The use in Sweden apparently even varies a little from region to region. However, I personally almost never use "denna", "detta" or "dessa" and don't hear it very often either.

##sin/sitt, hans, hennes, sina, deras

When you want to express that something/someone belongs to a certain person, without using that person's name, you use pronouns. Unfortunately the Swedish for "his", "her" or "their" holds some tricky aspects that might confuse you. Here is the classic example sentence to explain it.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Johan kysser _sin_ tjej. / Johan kysser _hans_ tjej.|Johan is kissing _his_ girlfriend.

However, in Swedish there is a distinction between the first and the second one in the following way.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Johan kysser _sin_ tjej.|Johan is kissing his (_his own_) girlfriend.
Johan kysser _hans_ tjej.|Johan is kissing his (_some other male person's_) girlfriend.

Think of it as an extra piece of information that just doesn't exist in the English language.

So how do you use it?

Use sin for "en" words, sitt for "ett" words (this is actually the same for both male and female) and "sina" for plural of both "en" or "ett" words.

As for when to use which of the two forms: this is actually a bit tricky to determine and involves analyzing each subsentence of whatever you want to say. My rule of thumb has always been to try and use actual names as often as possible. Whenever it doesn't sound totally stupid to replace the pronouns with names, do it.

The rest will come naturally, just be aware that this concept exists.

##Future: present, ska, kommer att

There are 3 forms of future that you should know about. When to use each of them will mostly come with time and input and there is not a lot that can go wrong here.

###just use present

In many cases it is totally fine to just use the present form and have some marker word that signals that you are actually talking about something in the future.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Jag _hämtar_ dig _om en timme_.|I _will pick you up_ _in an hour_.
Jag _reser_ till Sydafrika _nästa vecka_.|I _will travel_ to South Africa _next week_.

###kommer att + infinitive

This can be translated with "going to" or "will" and is built with "kommer att" + the infinite form of the verb.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Jag _kommer att göra_ det imorgon.|I _am going to do_ it tomorrow.
Jag _kommer att berätta_ om det här för mina föräldrar.|I _will tell_ my parents about this.

###ska + infinitive

This can also be roughly translated to "going to" or "will" and is built with "ska" + the infinite form of the verb.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Jag _ska_ inte _göra det_ igen.|I _will_ not _do it_ again.
Jag _ska resa_ till Tyskland på söndag.|I _will travel_ to Germany on Sunday.

Note that "ska" in Swedish can also be used to express something that rather translates to "shall" or "should" in English.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
_Ska_ vi ses igen någon gång?|_Should_ we meet again some time?

So when do you actually use "kommer att" and when do you use "ska" to express future tense? This is just like with "will" or "going to" a tricky question and something you will just develop a feeling for over time.
For now just use this rule of thumb: use "ska" when that event is really intended to happen or the outcome can't possibly be influenced (like tomorrow's weather) and "kommer att" when the event is planned to happen but it might come differently.

##Past: hade+verb, ha+verb, simple past

Just like there are different ways of expressing past tense in English e.g.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Jag _gjorde_ det igår.|I _did_ it yesterday. (simple past)
Jag _har_ redan _gjort_ det.|I _have_ already _done_ it. (perfect)
Jag _hade gjort_ det förut.|I _had done_ it before. (past perfect)

there are several ways in Swedish, too. Luckily the way of constructing them is pretty much the same way as in English. Unfortunately when to use which can be a bit different from the English language. But as usual: don't worry, everything will come with time.

###preteritum

This tense is just like the simple past in English built by simply changing the verb to it's past form. Those past forms can be quite irregular, so you will learn them with your flashcards. Since the conjugation of a verb is the same for all of the persons in the Swedish language, there is only one word you have to remember per verb. So that's good.

Preteritum should be used to describe actions that started in the past and were also finished in the past and don't influence the present.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Jag _såg_ en bra film igår.|I _saw_ a good movie yesterday.
Jag _gjorde_ det redan förra veckan.|I _did_ it last week already.
Vi _gick_ på restaurang för två dagar sen.|We _went_ to the restaurant two days ago.

###perfekt (har + infinite verb)

Just like the perfect tense in English it is built with the conjugated form of the verb "ha" (to have) and the verb you want to express in it's infinite form. That's pretty simple.

Use perfekt to express an action that started in the past but is still ongoing or has some kind of influence on the present.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Jag _har bott_ i Sverige sedan 2014.|I _have lived_ in Sweden since 2014.
Vi _har haft_ mycket stress i 2 veckor nu.|We _have had_ a lot of stress for 2 weeks now.
Hon _har_ inte _tagit_ med sig sin jacka, så nu fryser hon.|She _did_ not _take_ her jacket with her, so now she is freezing.

The last example shows the potential difference in the use of past tense between Swedish and English. The action (not taking her jacket with her) was completed in the past, but since the action has an influence on the present (you are freezing now) you would use perfekt in Swedish as opposed to simple past in English.

###pluskvamperfekt (hade + infinite verb)

This beautiful name stands for a tense that is used a lot like the English past perfect and is built by the past form of the verb "ha" and the verb in infinite form.

Pluskvamperfekt can be used to describe an action that had happened before another event in the past.

Svenska|English
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Jag _hade lärt_ mig Svenska innan jag kom hit.|I _had learned_ Swedish before I came here.
Han _hade sprungit_ varje dag innan han bröt sitt ben.|He _had been running_ every day before he broke his leg.

So the bottomline is that there are 3 past tenses that you can use in Swedish. Each of them has a counterpart in English and it is a good starting point to just always use the respective counterpart. Just be aware that sometimes there are slight differences between when you would use a certain past tense in Swedish or English, but that is really not a big problem. Everyone will still understand you, even if you pick the wrong tense every now and then. Past is past.
