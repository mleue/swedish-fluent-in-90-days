#The Method

> Wherever I see people doing something the way it's always been done, the way it's 'supposed' to be done, following the same old trends, well, that's just a big red flag to me to go look somewhere else.

When I started learning Swedish, I didn't have a clue about what would be the best and most efficient way to do it. All I had was a feeling that my experiences with language learning up to that point couldn't possibly be close to the best way. And I was eager to improve.

As an engineering student I am reminded every day to try and see the easy and applicable solutions to complex problems. You don't necessarily have to understand exactly why something works, just knowing that it works is usually good enough. In the same way I am by no means a neuroscientist and can explain to you why this way of learning languages works so incredibly well, but I certainly know that it does.

I like reading books about self-improvement and learning and am familiar with the experience that sometimes new concepts can strike you as revolutionary in an instant. You can immediately see how a new habit or a new way of thinking will have a positive impact on your life. Those _eureka_ moments usually define the difference between an awesome and an average performance. You decide which one you want.

I've certainly had a couple of those epiphanies when I dove deep into language learning and that is exactly what this guide is about: I would like to pass them on to you in a purified and condensed form.

So here is how it goes. There are three cornerstones in my method that you will incorporate in your daily training.

##Listening

You are going to listen to Swedish from the first day on. Mostly interesting radio shows or podcasts that boost your understanding and give you a feeling for the language. Your brain will basically be out in deep water from day one and you will be amazed at how fast it can learn to swim.

The national publicly funded radio company in Sweden is _Sveriges Radio_. They offer a wide range of different programs for everyones' taste and also have a brilliant app, available for iOS and Android. If you do not own a smartphone you can, of course, access all the content on their website, too.

The best thing about it is that they don't only stream live on 4 different channels but they also have a big archive of old shows. So if you fall in love with a particular show (like I have with „vetandets värld“, a daily 25min science podcast) you can easily get a lot of input just by accessing the old episodes of the last months or even years.

Oh and it is also entirely free. Nice.

##Vocabulary

At some point early on in my research for Swedish I read about [AJATT][ajatt] (all Japanese all the time). It's a website by a guy that taught himself Japanese without taking classes or being in Japan. He describes the core of his method as the _10,000 sentences_ principle. Meaning that if you know and understand around 10,000 sentences or phrases in a language you will feel comfortable in whatever situation you might find yourself in. I was instantly hooked by this fresh approach to language learning.

Unfortunately it took this guy 18 months to become fluent in Japanese, so that was not really the fast performance I was looking for. But I would soon learn that this approach, combined with a smart flashcard app and a lot of visual and verbal input would enable me to beat his time quite significantly.[^31]

The idea itself was my starting point, though. I think that knowing a lot of correct sentences and phrases and intuitively understanding their meaning and when to use them is a very natural description of language proficiency.

In my mothertongue I don't think about grammar, word order, vocabulary and so on. I would rather describe a typical conversation as: recognizing sentences and phrases intuitively without any effort and then replying in the same way. I certainly don't think about language when I'm talking in German. The sentences are rather jumping into my mind, just because I have heard, seen and used them hundreds of times before.

Of course, that is a skill that has been shaped over many years throughout my childhood. But there are several important factors, as to why we can cut that process short, that become clear when you compare the capabilities of babies and adults.

|Babies|Adults|
--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
|Learn unconsciously and in small portions that are not necessarily high value | Are conscious of the learning process and their goals and use high-value input at any given time of the training|
|Do not understand the concept of language | Are aware of the concept and can relate to new languages based on their mothertongue|
|Have to understand the world around them at the same time as learning how to communicate, without having a clear focus | Have grown brains and a single target: learning the language as fast and efficiently as possible|
|Have to learn to use their senses and have no skill set for maximized input | Can consume visual and auditory input without any problems and possess a great skill for maximizing input: the ability to read|

You might have heard people say that you will never again learn a language as easily as when you were a child. That certainly holds true if you only look at how our brain matures and how it will not make new connections as fast anymore when growing older. But for the reasons given in the above table I firmly believe that adults actually have an enormous advantage over children when it comes to language learning and no one, however old, should be afraid to take on this endeavour.

From French and Spanish classes I was used to long vocabulary lists for every chapter that you were supposed to somehow feed to your brain. Even if there was some amazing method to actually memorize these lists of highly unconnected words, I would still dislike the approach. Ultimately we communicate in sentences, not words. Memorizing a lot of words and then not knowing how to put them together to a useful and correct sentence is probably the single biggest waste of time when learning a language. You are not going to do that.

I have prepared 10,000 sentences for you as flashcards that you are going to use in a spaced repetition software that will expose you to the sentence just when it is about to slip out of your memory again. It is going to be a rock-solid foundation for your Swedish skills. Later on, when in a conversation, the sentences will just pop into your head. It is an incredible feeling.

##Reading

Reading books is the perfect maximized language input. I read 7 swedish books in total when I was actively studying and every single one of them was a huge boost for my overall understanding of the language. People who like reading will certainly have a small advantage here.

The key is to try and start with books that you have already read before and whose plot is familiar to you, but which you can still imagine yourself reading once more. Try to think about books that you genuinely liked to read and that really sucked you in and kept you up in the evening because you desperately wanted to read just a couple more chapters. It should also be a book that is a relatively easy read and not some bulky science doorstopper.

A good example for that is the Harry Potter series, which I used 4 books of. I have always loved those, usually longing for the next one to be released throughout my childhood. I just wholeheartedly enjoyed the story and could easily immerse myself in it. Also I had probably already read each of the 7 books at least twice in German and once in English. That way I just know the story and don't have to look up every single word in the beginning, because I can understand a lot of them intuitively from the context.

So after reading book 1, 5, 6 and 7 of Harry Potter, I then made the transition to actual Swedish books, to somehow connect a bit more to real Swedish culture. Of course you can just keep on reading whatever you like, but reading something that origins from Sweden just appealed to me. A book with a plot that is happening in e.g. Stockholm or Gothenburg felt just that little bit more exciting and real. Also, when I actually visited Sweden later on, it was quite cool to recognize some of the places I had read about.

All of Scandinavia seems to be obsessed with crime novels, so it is quite easy to find some really good and thrilling books. I had heard about the _Millenium_ trilogy before and it was even made into a major motion picture in 2011 called _The girl with the dragon tattoo_ in English. Those three books were really thrilling and I was flying through them. So I can really recommend those, but I will later give other examples, too.

##The Foundation

Just to give you some more insight into the underlying principles that make this method so effective, here are the three most important that this guide is based on.

###Pareto's Law or 80/20 principle

Whatever subject you encounter in your life, there is a good chance that at least parts of it are governed by this brilliant principle which says that usually you can get about 80% of the returns by making around 20% of the investment. In our case this means that we are not aiming for perfection but rather a solid advanced fluency level (80%) by only investing 20% of the time it would take to become a perfectly natural speaker. Also all of the material you will use is chosen in a way that it represents the 20% critical mass, anything that doesn't get you forward fast is stripped away.

###Parkinson's Law

Parkinson's Law is an interesting observation stating that the completion of a task usually takes as much time as you schedule for it. Have you ever noticed that on the last day before an important exam you can easily learn just as much as the whole week before combined?

Why is that? - Because you have a deadline that can't be moved!

An approaching deadline can be your best friend when it comes to limiting the time to complete a task or project. You will be more focused and study more creatively once you know that there is just no other choice if you don't want to fail.

###Accountability

Just having a deadline in your mind is not going to cut it. It would be way to easy for you to just push it back or erase it altogether. "I just didn't find the time", "It's been a pretty stressful period" … I can already hear you say. So what you need to do is transform your quiet, little, personal goal into a big, loud, hairy, public goal. Tell your friends about it, tell your family about, write it big into your calendar. Put yourself in a position where failing to reach your goal would be embarrassing. Put yourself under pressure.

##Take action

1. Tell 5 friends or family members about your goal of becoming fluent in Swedish within 3 months. Get them excited about the project and your progress. If they say it can't be done, just tell them they'll see, this will fire up your motivation even more.

2. Choose one really close friend or family member as your referee. This person must ask you about your progress on a fixed day every week. Be sure to choose someone who can kick your butt if necessary.

3. Optional (but highly recommended): Give 50 €/$ (or the equivalent in your currency) to your referee and tell him to donate it to a foundation that is working against all the values you stand for or tell him to spend it all at once on something that you think is a total waste of money. However, if you succeed, you will get the money back.

[^31]: Admittedly, Japanese is probably a lot harder to learn than Swedish (at least with my background), but then again I was actually 6x faster than he was.
